# Movie Database with React JS, Redux, Nest JS & MongoDB
## How to run

It would help if you used Docker to run the project. After you install Docker, please open it.

From the root folder, run the command `docker-compose up -d`.

Now go to the *backend* and run `npm install`. Then run the backend with this command `nest start --watch`.

Again go to the *frontend* folder and run `npm install`. Then run the frontend with this command `npm start`.
